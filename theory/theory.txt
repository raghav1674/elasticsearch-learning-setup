There are two security mechanisms and two connection modes.


security modes:
  - Api key
  - Certificate based - authentication is local but the role info is passed to another cluster and access is given

connection mode:
  - sniff:
      - not only master
      - version same
  - proxy:
      - one proxy to multiple
